                        Rubber duck debugging (or "d√©bogage canard" as the French would say) is a problem solving method, 
                        whereby you explain a problem (to an inanimate object), in the hopes you reach a solution through the 
                        process of your explanation. Instead of an inanimate object, try using a willing human.

                    <p class="govuk-body">It is best practised when you can:</p>
